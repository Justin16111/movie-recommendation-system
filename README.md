🎬 Movie Recommendation System (AI/ML)

A content-based Movie Recommendation System built using **Machine Learning** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.  
The system recommends movies similar to a given movie based on textual features such as overview, genres, keywords, cast, and director.

🔍 Project Overview

This project uses **content-based filtering** to recommend movies.  
Instead of relying on user ratings, it analyzes movie metadata and finds similarities between movies using NLP techniques.

The recommendation is generated by computing **cosine similarity** between vectorized movie features.

🧠 Technologies & Tools Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn**
- **NLP (CountVectorizer)**
- **Cosine Similarity**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **GitHub**

---

 📊 Dataset

- **TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset**
- Source: Kaggle
- Contains metadata for ~4,800 movies including:
  - Overview
  - Genres
  - Keywords
  - Cast
  - Crew (Director)

## ⚙️ How the System Works

1. Load and merge movie and credits datasets  
2. Clean and preprocess text data  
3. Extract important features:
   - Top 3 actors
   - Director
   - Genres & keywords
4. Combine all features into a single **tags** column  
5. Convert text into numerical vectors using **CountVectorizer**
6. Compute similarity using **cosine similarity**
7. Recommend the **top 5 similar movies**
